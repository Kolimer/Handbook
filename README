Before I say anything, I will say thank you
for reading this Read me!

This is my BukkitDev plugin named "Handbook"
which is basically a required plugin for any
server. I am basing this plugin off Essentials
but trying to make it more light-weight and
to make it run more efficient!

This is a solo project, and I am not planning
on inviting anyone to help work on it, but my
planning may change in the future.

If anyone is interested in translating the
plugin to another language that you know,
then please contact me by private message
but only message me if the language you
want to translate to is your native
language or you are fluent in that language
